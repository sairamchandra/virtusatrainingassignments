1.in which language we used inline functions .?
C++ inline function is powerful concept that is commonly used with classes.
 If a function is inline, the compiler places a copy of the code of that
 function at each point where the function is called at compile time.



where we used for
The inline functions are a C++ enhancement feature to 
increase the execution time of a program. Functions can be instructed to
 compiler to make them inline so that compiler 
can replace those function definition wherever those are being called.

An inline function is a function that is 
expanded inline when it is invoked, thus saving time. 
The compiler replaces the function call with the corresponding
 function code, which reduces the overhead of function calls.

2.what is the process of dom updation.?
DOM processing is the time it takes to parse
 the HTML into a DOM and retrieve or execute synchronous scripts.
 If the browser starts to download images in this phase,
 page load timing will capture the image load time.


With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:

JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page


example

html: <P id="foo">Foo</p>
js:var foo = document.getElementById('foo');

function tellViewerLoading() {
  // Tell the user that loading is occuring.
  foo.innerHTML = 'loading...';   
}

function someActionThatTakesALongTime() {
  // Do some action that takes a long time.
  var i = 0;
  while(i < 100000) {i++; console.log(i);};
}

function domUpdateDelayExperiment() {
  tellViewerLoading();
  someActionThatTakesALongTime();
}

domUpdateDelayExperiment();

3.what is difference between web page and application


Web Application: Web application is a piece of software that can be accessed by the browser. A Browser is an application that is used to browse the internet.
Web application needs authentication. The web application uses a combination of server-side scripts and client-side scripts to present information. It requires a server to manage requests from the users.
Example: Google Apps

Website: Website is a collection of related web pages that contains images, text, audio, video, etc. It can be consist of one page, two pages, and n number of pages.
A website provides visual and text content that users can view and read.
To view a website requires a browser(chrome, firefox). There are many types of websites like Archive website, Blog, Community website, Dating website, etc.
Example: Amazon, youtube, etc.
